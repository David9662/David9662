Hi, my name is **Oduor David Otieno**.
Am currently, a final year, pharmacy student at Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology.
I have always been interested in Software Engineering ever since I was a child❤️. Although am not studying this field in school, I have been teaching myself
how to code from the internet.I have been learning specifically, Web Development from various platforms such as The Odin Project, FreeCode Camp, and Educative.io.
It is safe to say that I can now provide clean code and pixel perfect design.I can make the web page more interactive primarily using HTML | CSS | JavaScript.
I have also been accepted by ALXafrica where I will be learning and training to be a full stack Software Engineer.
I value learning, scholarship, teaching and personal integrity above all else. I love challenges and things that push me out of my comfort-zone because
I believe this is the only way one can grow and learn various skills.
